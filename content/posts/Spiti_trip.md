Spiti is a high-altitude region of the Himalayas, located in the north-eastern part of the northern Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. The name "Spiti" means "The middle land", i.e. the land between Tibet and India.

Nestled amidst the Himalayas, at 13980 ft above sea level, with its desert climate and utter remoteness, the town of Kaza is probably one of the best places on the planet to capture the night sky.
