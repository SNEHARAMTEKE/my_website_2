title: About Me

Hello! I am Sneha Ramteke. I am from India. I moved to London in August 2022 to pursue Masters in Analytics and Management from London Business School. I graduated from the Indian Insititute of Technology, Kharagpur in 2020 with a Bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering and a Masters degree in Instrumentation and Signal Processing.

Before joining LBS, I worked as a Data Analyst at Accenture, India. Working at Accenture introduced me to the world of Consulting and deepned my interest in Analytics Consulting. I wanted to understand more on how Artificial Intelligence is changing the way businesses operate all over the world. Hence, I decided to take up the Masters in Analytics and Management program at LBS. I aim to take up Data oriented roles in consulting after finishing my degree. 

I like to act, dance and cook in my free time. While I am trained in Indian classical dance form Kathak, acting comes naturally to me. I ventured into acting after joining the Dramatics club at IIT Kharagpur and then there was no going back. I started to love acting more than dancing and actively contributed to various dramatics activities during college. 

Sometimes, you may find me deeply engrosed in a book. I could never imagine myself as an avid reader in my early school years. I could hardly finish a book during my high school. In the third year of college, I met with an accident and got a cast on my leg for a month. Extremely bored and frustrated, I started to read a book from my brother's collection of novels. I got pulled into the book in no time and finished reading it in 3 days. The book was "The Alchemist" by Paulo Coelho which is one of my favourites. I am glad that I still enjoy reading and I have read many more interesting books since my "life changing accident". Here is one of my favourite quotes from The Alchemist.
