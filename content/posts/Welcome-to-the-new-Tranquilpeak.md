title: About Me

Hello! I am Sneha Ramteke. I am from India. I moved to London in August 2022 to pursue Masters in Analytics and Management from London Business School. I graduated from the Indian Insititute of Technology, Kharagpur in 2020 with a Bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering and a Masters degree in Instrumentation and Signal Processing.

Before joining LBS, I worked as a Data Analyst at Accenture, India. Working at Accenture introduced me to the world of Consulting and deepned my interest in Analytics Consulting. I wanted to understand more on how Artificial Intelligence is changing the way businesses operate all over the world. Hence, I decided to take up the Masters in Analytics and Management program at LBS. I aim to take up Data oriented roles in consulting after finishing my degree.
